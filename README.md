# DangoSmash
LudumDare 35 Jam Entry

Theme: ShapeShift!

Whack-a-mole style game called DangoSmash ('cause they are dangos, not moles!) with a twist.
Made in 48 hours, as work calls on monday.

### Controls
Left Click to swing down the left hammer and hit squared dangos to score.
Right Click for the right hammer and hit round dangos to score.
Hit a wrong one or the baby (evil you) and get minus score!  
Occasionally the dango shapeshifts afte being hit. 
Hit it again (with the correct hammer) and again until it stops or you do not score.  
If you are successfull, you score a lot though...

Code by me and art by Pia Bsdurrek.
SFX by both of us.
